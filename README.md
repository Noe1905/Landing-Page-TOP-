# Sao Paulo Landing Page
This project showcases my foundational HTML and CSS skills, developed through my studies with The Odin Project. In building this site, I will:
* Create a well-structured index.
* Organize elements into divs for effective styling.
* Utilize flexbox for layout, ensuring proper use of formatting and styles required for the project.

On a personal note: The Odin Project has challenged and inspired me in ways I hadn't anticipated. There's something about web development that just clicks for me, and Iâ€™m really enjoying the journey.
